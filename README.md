# HTTP_lab

## Description
This project implements an HTTP client-server system that supports basic HTTP protocol operations such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `HEAD`. It includes advanced features like resource management, multimedia file transfer, and a graphical interface for the client.

## Completed Features
- **HTTP Client with GUI:** A graphical interface built with `Gradio` to send HTTP requests interactively.
- **Multimedia File Transfer:** Support for transferring images, audio, and video between client and server.
- **CRUD Persistence:** Resource management with CRUD operations stored in a JSON file.
- **Functional HTTP Server:** Implementation of a server supporting multiple HTTP methods and restricted access to private folders.
